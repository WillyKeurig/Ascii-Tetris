TUI TETRIS IN C     - Angelo van Meurs 2022/04/12
_________________

This program was created for the sole purpose of displaying
acquired skills and knowledge about the language C.

For this reason I chose to recreate Tetris using ASCII representation. The
decision to make it ASCII is one of convenience, not lack of interest:
I have not worked with GUI's in C. It is beyond the scope of this
project to learn to do so.

Disclaimer: I have never made a Tetris game in any language.

To challenge myself I added dynamic functionality such as:
    -   4x4 shapes
    -   Variably sized matrix       (optional)
    -   Extra shapes                (optional)

In addition to those functionalities, I have implemented
some restrictions during the development process:

A = Allowed; X = Prohibited;

A   READ External resources regarding "phenotype" Tetris:
    In-game shapes, scoreboard, legal moves, etc.
X   COPY External resources regarding "phenotype" Tetris:
    In-game shapes, scoreboard, legal moves, etc.
X   READ/COPY external resources regarding "genotype" Tetris:
    Source code, snippets, formulas, etc.

A   READ External resources regarding C:
    Conventions, best-practices, syntax, etc.
X   COPY External resources regarding C:
    Conventions, best-practices, syntax, etc.

Enjoy.
